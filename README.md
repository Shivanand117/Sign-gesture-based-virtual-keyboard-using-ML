# Sign-gesture-based-virtual-keyboard-using-ML
The Sign Gesture-Based Virtual Keyboard uses ML, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to detect hand gestures via webcam and map them to keyboard inputs. A trained TensorFlow/Keras model classifies gestures (Aâ€“Z, special keys) in real time, enabling hands-free, accessible, and intuitive text input for various applications.
